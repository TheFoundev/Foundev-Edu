# A beginner's model of declared dependencies and runtime configuration

**Lesson ID:** `electricity-consumption-analytics-module-06-lesson-1`

## Purpose and learning objectives

Inspect the actual manifests setup.py. Separate declared packages/settings from imports, installed state, secrets, and runtime success.

By the end, you can explain the role of the listed source files, locate a declaration or configuration value, trace how it is used, and state what the excerpt does not prove.

## Prerequisites

Read [prerequisites.md](../../../prerequisites.md). For lesson 2, complete lesson 1 first.

## Beginner explanation

A source file is one working part of a larger program. Its imports show what it relies on; its declarations show the operations or settings it makes available; its callers show whether and how that part is used. Read these relationships as a path through the project.

## From mental model to implementation

Begin with the role of the source files in this module: `setup.py`. The code excerpt below is the evidence to study. Read imports first, then find declarations, then follow one call or data value into its next use.

## What the excerpt shows

- In `setup.py`, `from setuptools import setup, find_packages` brings a module or package name into this file; follow later references before claiming it is used on a running path.

These observations describe visible imports and declarations. Check function bodies and callers before inferring exact data transformations or runtime use.

## Step-by-step source reading

1. Open the complete file shown below; the excerpt is truncated for portability.
2. Mark imports, top-level declarations, and any configuration or data boundaries.
3. For a function or class, write down parameters and visible return/output operations. For configuration or documentation, identify the exact key or claim and where source consumes or implements it.
4. Search the repository for callers, imports, or tests referencing the declaration.
5. Compare documentation and implementation, recording confirmed facts separately from unknown runtime behavior.

## Source evidence

### setup.py

```text
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='SMAP',  # Replace with the name of your library
    version='0.1.1',  # Replace with your library's version
    author='Evgenii Genov',  # Replace with your name
    author_email='eugengenov@gmail.com',  # Replace with your email address
    description='This libary is a recreation of an R package for smart meter alanlysis of consumption and temperature time-series. ',  # Replace with a brief description of your library
    long_description=open('README.md').read(),  # Long description read from the the readme file
    long_description_content_type='text/markdown',
    url='https://github.com/yourusername/SMAP',  # Replace with the link to your github or project website
    packages=find_packages(exclude=('tests', 'docs')),
    install_requires=[
        'polars>=0.20.31'  # Replace with the version of Polars you are using or compatible with

    ],
    classifiers=[
        # Trove classifiers
        # Full list: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers
        'Development Status :: 3 - Alpha',  # Change as appropriate
        'Intended Audience :: Developers',
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',  # Change as appropriate
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8',
    ],
    python_requires='>=3.6',  # Replace with the Python version requirements
    keywords='meter analytics polars',  # Replace with keywords relevant to your library
)

```

The excerpt comes from this project’s source tree and may omit context. It is not evidence that the source was executed. Never treat a listed function name alone as proof that a user-facing path reaches it.

## Expected behavior and known limits

Only behavior visible in the cited implementation or assertions can be explained as implemented. External calls, deployment settings, successful installation, performance, and test outcomes remain unverified here.

## Practical exercise

Use the module exercise to create a call/data/configuration trace for these exact files. Include a source location for every claim.

## Common mistakes and debugging

- Reading only function names: follow bodies, callers, and return paths.
- Assuming imports prove an integration ran: inspect the call site and configuration.
- Assuming tests pass because they exist: record execution separately.
- If the path is unclear, search all references to the symbol and trace from the actual entry point.

## Best practices and security

Use synthetic fixtures and isolated environments. Redact credentials and personal data. Review validation at input boundaries, dependency declarations, and error handling before suggesting a change.

## Summary

This lesson ties its explanation to `setup.py`. A sound account distinguishes source evidence from inferred behavior.

## Knowledge checks

1. Which visible declaration or configuration element is central to this module?
2. What caller, test, or downstream use would strengthen your explanation?
3. Which conclusion would require execution rather than source inspection?
